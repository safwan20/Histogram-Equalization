# SMARTAIL Hiring Task
From the 2 given options, I chose to implement the Histogram equalization one. I am having problem with C++ due to Opencv. But I have implemented using python without any libraries from scratch.

### Steps to run
1. Create a python3 virtual enviornment.
2. Install the requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the **Flask** app using `python main.py`.
4. Now that the server is running, you can make POST requests to the `/equalize` endpoint for grayscale images or `/equalize_color` for color images.
5. Linear filtered Images will be saved in `Equalized_images` with thier filename prefix with `equalized`.

### Deployment
deployment can be done in pythonanywhere cloud server.
